cool-old-term is a terminal emulator which tries to mimic the look and feel of the old cathode tube screens.
It has been designed to be eye-candy, customizable, and reasonably lightweight.

It is a fork of another qt5 terminal emulator: https://github.com/jorgen/yat

To build and launch it (Qt5.2 are required):

git clone https://github.com/Swordifish90/cool-old-term
cd cool-old-term
qmake
make
./cool-old-term

This is still an eary release, but you are free to test it and tell me what do you think.
